This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#setwd("/Users/chenhe/Documents/StudyING/Coursera/2015 Practical Machine Learning/00. Final Project")
###################
#   Read in data
###################
library(caret)
training=read.csv(file="pml-training.csv",header=TRUE, sep=",")
testing=read.csv(file="pml-testing.csv",header=TRUE, sep=",")

levels(training[,2])  #Check for the number of users and their names
colnames(training)
x=colSums(is.na(training))
y=colSums(is.na(testing))
yy=(union(which(x>0),which(y>0)))
deleteCol=yy[order(yy)]
training=training[,-deleteCol]

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
